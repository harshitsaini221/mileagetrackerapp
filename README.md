Mileage Tracker App

Few Points to Note:

The App right now doesnâ€™t have various user support, I have added 1-2 expenses and you can hence proceed to add expenses.
In Add Expense Screen, The Odometer Value & Date Value should be Greater than the last entered Values.
The Gas (l) is right now manual input, since at petrol pumps, you can see the amount of gas that has been filled in your vehicle.
Enter your DB Link, I used Firebase!
